there are 28 states and 8 UTs in india. 
my favourite state is karnataka
but maharashtra is also good

karnataka is known for bangalore
maharashtra is known for mumbai 

the below code is written by dev branch.
other than karnataka and maharashtra, kashmir and bengal are best known in india for history.
